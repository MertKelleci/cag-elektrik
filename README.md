# ÇAĞ ELEKTRIK DESKTOP APP

This is the desktop app I've developed for Çağ Elektrik.

## Technologies Used

1.  Electron.JS for building the app as a desktop app.
1.  Firebase for authentication and realtime database.
1.  React for frontend.
    1. SASS for styling.
    1. Framer Motion for animations.

### `yarn electron:serve`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn electron:build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
